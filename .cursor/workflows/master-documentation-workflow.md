# Master Documentation & Architecture Workflow with Validation

You are executing a comprehensive documentation workflow that generates, validates, and improves project documentation through automated accuracy verification, then creates architecture diagrams.

## Workflow Overview

This workflow creates a **self-improving documentation system** that:

1. Applies agent rules and context
2. Generates comprehensive documentation from source code using **generic prompt**
3. Validates documentation accuracy against the actual codebase AND applies corrections using **composite context**
4. Creates architecture diagrams based on validated documentation
5. Creates a feedback loop for continuous improvement **without polluting generic prompts**
6. **Tracks execution history** with automatic run logging for audit and improvement

## Workflow Run History Tracking

Every workflow execution automatically creates/updates `.cursor/workflows/workflow-run-history.md` with:

- **Timestamp**: When the workflow was executed
- **Command**: Which execution mode was used (default, --quick, --doc-only, etc.)
- **Files Generated**: List of all files created or modified during execution
- **Execution Duration**: Time taken for the workflow
- **Success Status**: Whether the workflow completed successfully

**History File Format**:
```markdown
# Workflow Execution History

## Run #[N] - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]
- **Command**: Execute documentation workflow [flags]
- **Mode**: [Full/Quick/Doc-Only/Diagram-Only/Validation-Only]
- **Duration**: [X] minutes
- **Status**: [SUCCESS/FAILED/PARTIAL]
- **Files Generated**:
  - docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md (created/updated)
  - docs/architecture_diagram.html (created/updated)
  - .cursor/learning/workflow-learnings.md (created/updated)
- **Notes**: [Any relevant execution notes]
```

This provides automatic audit trail and helps identify patterns in workflow usage and success rates.

## Execution Sequence

### Phase 1: Agent Context Setup

**Execute**: Read and apply agent rules from `.cursor/rules/rules.md`

**Goal**: Define your role as a principal software engineer and set the boundaries for your analysis.

**Output**: Agent context and role established

### Phase 2: Documentation Generation

**Execute**: `.cursor/prompts/documentation-generation-prompt.md`

**Goal**: Generate comprehensive project documentation using the **generic, technology-agnostic prompt** with universal validation requirements.

**Important**: The documentation-generation-prompt.md must remain **generic and reusable** across all project types (frontend, backend, different tech stacks).

**Output**: `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`

### Phase 3: Documentation Validation & Correction (Enhanced)

**Execute**: `.cursor/prompts/documentation-validation-prompt.md`

**Goal**: Systematically validate the generated documentation against the source code to identify inaccuracies AND apply corrections using composite context.

**Inputs**:

- Generated documentation from Phase 2
- Access to complete source codebase
- The **generic** documentation generation prompt

**Actions**:

1. **Validation**: Systematically verify every claim in the documentation against the actual source code
2. **Learning Creation**: Create `.cursor/learning/workflow-learnings.md` with **project-specific validation insights, patterns, and technology-specific validation rules**
3. **Composite Context Application**: Update `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` using BOTH:
   - The generic `.cursor/prompts/documentation-generation-prompt.md`
   - The project-specific `.cursor/learning/workflow-learnings.md`
4. **Learning Enhancement**: Update `.cursor/learning/workflow-learnings.md` with additional execution metrics, patterns, and insights
5. **Generic Prompt Preservation**: Keep `.cursor/prompts/documentation-generation-prompt.md` unchanged and reusable

**Outputs**:

- Display validation findings in chat window
- Corrected and validated `docs/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `.cursor/learning/workflow-learnings.md` with project-specific validation insights and technology-specific rules
- `.cursor/learning/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` with detailed accuracy metrics and validation findings
- **DO NOT** update the generic documentation-generation-prompt.md

### Phase 4: Architecture Diagram Generation

**Execute**: `.cursor/prompts/diagram-generation-prompt.md`

**Goal**: Create architecture diagram using the validated documentation as additional context.

**Inputs**:

- Validated and corrected documentation from Phase 3
- Codebase analysis
- Component mapping information

**Output**: `docs/architecture_diagram.html`
